Experience
----------

### **ISW Development PTY LTD** (KudosApps)

**Software Engineer** | April 2016 - Present <br>
Battery Point, Tasmania

One of the Kudos team that works across the entire suite of Kudos Apps. Primarily focused on our flagship product, Kudos Boards, building great new features based on great new tech. I work on the front, back and side toside with React, NodeJS, Microservices, Docker, Jenkins and Kubernetes. Sometimes I get out to conferences to tell you about how amazing KudosBoards is. Rarely I'll also run a presentation on a topic I enjoy at those conferences.
<br>
<br>
### **University of Tasmania**
**Software Developer and Tudor** | November 2015 - April 2016 <br>
Sandy Bay, Tasmania

Solo software developer for two research teams, one working with the earliest versions of the Oculus Rift virtual reality headset to develop a Unity Engine based VR environment for studying the effectiveness of Virtual Reality in treating ornithophobia (bird fear). The other team working with the logistics industry to develop a mobile app that assists with tracking driver fatigue and completing heavy vehicle log book entries. Plus plenty of tutoring software classes for the Computing faculty.
<br>
<br>
### **Officeworks**
**Print and Copy Team Member** | November 2011 - January 2016<br>
Hobart, Tasmania

Most Officeworks stores have a decent sized printing centre with huge lasercopiers, large format poster and canvas printers and all sorts of tools forcutting and binding everything that comes out of those printers. I had thepleasure of taking people's digital ideas and making them real! A perfectly wrapped canvas of stunning scenery caught in the Nepalese Himalayas, a very neatly punched and bound production of a PHD thesis that had been worked on for three years. So much comes out of this print shop.

<br>
### **McDonald's**
**2nd Assistant Manager** | 2008 - 2011<br>
Kingston, Tasmania

After a year (2007) of clocking plenty of hours, romancing customers, grilling beef and cleaning floors, the management team at McDonald's Kingston agreed to take me on full time and put me through McDonald's Restaurant Management Curriculum, earning Cert III in Retail. My responsibilities in this management role were to delegate responsibilities to all team members working my shift, monitor and adjust resources for restaurant performance and generally be the sole responsible person on site.
<br>
<br>
### **UXC Applications Development**
**Internal Support Technician** | October 2007 - March 2008<br>
Hobart

My old IT Networking teacher and I ran the internal support/helpdesk for a software development company in Hobart that has since joined DXC. At the time, we had an office of 50 or so desks. Most of my tasks were basic IT support, managing AD users, wifi permissios, fixing PCs. I did get the chance to work on a few projects like adding new wifi access points and building a new file server.

Recent Projects
--------------------
### Kudos Boards 'Docker'
**Stack**: JavaScript (ES9), React/AngularJS, Node.js ([cote](https://github.com/dashersw/cote)) microservices, MongoDB,  Docker, Jenkins, Helm, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform<br>
**Product Page**: https://kudosapps.com/boards<br>
**Authored Media**: http://bit.ly/linkedin-multi-paste, http://bit.ly/kudos-blog-shortcuts

Kudos Boards is a highly scalable, microservices based, collborative task and information management application. Originally built as a cloud application, now deployable in any Kubernetes environment for customers to run privately.

Kudos Boards has seen the bulk of my work for the past two years, along with three other engineers. My primary focus has been developing new front end features in React and porting existing components from AngularJS to React. I'm responsible for the majority of the work for supporting mobile and touch devices. I've also been able to spend some time working on the rest of the stack when I built a new micro service that uses [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer/) to generate images of components from our applications. 

This involved working on the entire CI pipeline, writing the service's Dockerfile, creating a new Jenkins pipeline to automate building and deployment, updating Kudos Boards' Helm charts to include the new service and deploying Kudos Boards to Kubernetes on GCP using Helm.

### Social Connections Berlin Presentation

**Event Page**: http://bit.ly/markd-socnx-berlin<br>
**Slide Deck**: http://bit.ly/markd-pwa-slides

In October 2018 I presented a session at the Social Connections conference in Berlin about some of the latest concepts in front end application development: Progressive Web Applications. PWAs were a trend I had been following for several months, around this time support by operating systems and browsers was almost complete, so a great topic to cover for the conference's 'New Technology' track. I was a bit nervous in the lead up, but worked with a very supportive team and had the chance to meet many of the attendees before my presentation. Overall, the session had great attendance and was well received, so I'm looking forward to makeing more presentations in the future!

### Kudos Tools CCM Migrator
**Stack**: JavaScript (ES9), Create React App, IBM Connections, JAVA EE, IBM WebSphere<br>
**Product Page**: https://kudosapps.com/kudos-tools-ccm-migrator<br>
*Check out the demo video by me on the product page!*

CCM Migrator started as a one off project with ISW's consulting team and Belsoft Collaboration AG of Switzerland. Belsoft had a client that needed to migrate files and metadata out of IBM Connections Content Manager (CCM) into IBM Connections Files. Two months in and the application was mostly functional. The front end was very basic HTML generated by JSP and some basic javascript. My director approached me to 'productise' the application since he thought there may be opportunities to resell the application. Using my previous experience with both React and Websphere applications, I came up with a plan for how we could combind a React front end with a WebSphere application. My director and the consulting team were concerned about the effort needed to rebuild the front end on React, but I persisted. I built the modern looking React application and matched the previous features within 3 days. Well within expectations. I later used my Java experience to give recommendations to the consulting team for improving performance and fixing memory problems. 


### Kudos Boards 'Websphere' for IBM Connections
**Stack**: Bootstrap, backbone.marionette, IBM Connections, JAVA EE, DB2 SQL, IBM WebSphere<br>
**Authored Media**: http://bit.ly/markd-kudos-blog<br>
**Customers**: ABN AMRO Bank, Dutch Tax Office, Groz-Beckert

For the past three years I have been the primary developer and maintainer of the WebSphere version of Kudos Boards for IBM Connections. Boards is a feature rich Kanban application that very tightly integrates with IBM Connections, an enterprise collaboration platform. It even stores it's data in the same database as another IBM Connections application.

This is our most successful product and has led to me working closley with huge customers around the world. 

### Kudos Badges for IBM Connections
**Stack**: Dojo Toolkit, IBM Connections, DB2 SQL, Java EE, IBM WebSphere<br>
**Product Page**: https://kudosapps.com/badges<br>
**Customers**: Colgate-Palmolive, Pepsico, Wells Fargo

Kudos Badges is a fully customisable achievement system for IBM Connections. Generally, users are awarded a badge based on whether a metric (database query that returns a number) has reached a certain threshold. This was built with a powerful metric and filtering system that made it easy for managers to create their own complex badges without having to write their own SQL.

Over the past three years I have been responsible for multiple projects with Wells Fargo and Kudos Badges, covering the whole process of requirements solicitation, design and development.

Personal Interests
--------------
If you made it down here, thank you! 

On the weekends, I'm a volunteer committee member for [Hobart Games Society](http://www.hogs.org.au/), a public organisation that runs board game nights in halls around Hobart. I make *and share* homebrew beer, cider and wine, and aspire to enter a mead into competition. In the summer I try to kite surf without injuring myself.

Most Officeworks stores have a decent sized printing centre with huge lasercopiers, large format poster and canvas printers and all sorts of tools forcutting and binding everything that comes out of those printers. I had thepleasure of taking people's digital ideas and making them real! A perfectly wrapped canvas of stunning scenery caught in the Nepalese Himalayas, a very neatly punched and bound production of a PHD thesis that had been worked on for three years. So much comes out of this print shop.
